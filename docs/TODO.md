## Notes

- Features are ordered by implementation difficulty, not necessarily by importance
- Start with Phase 2 features as they're foundational for user workflows
- Each completed feature should include tests and documentation
- Consider user feedback when prioritizing features
- Keep data.table patterns consistent throughout

**Quick Start Next Steps:**
1. Implement manual entry form (#2)
2. Add project/task creation (#1)
